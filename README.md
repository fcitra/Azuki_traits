This is the github documentation to retrieve Azuki traits and separate them to female and male Azukis.

1.  I retrieved all traits of 10k Azuki tokens from OpenSea API
    File: Obtain NFT traits.ipynb
2.  I observed visually all Azukis having androgynous hair style and listed all the visually female ones
    File: Visually female Azuki.csv
3.  I assigned each Azuki a gender
    File: Azuki_gender_generation.ipynb
4.  I coded a workbook for generating table for usage in dune analytics
    File: Create_user_generated_table.ipynb 

Final datasets:
1.  azuki_traits_dataframe.csv
    Dataframe of traits of 10k Azuki tokens
2.  azuki_traits_with_gender_df.csv
    Dataframe of traits of 10k Azuki tokens plus gender: 

The user generated data I created for Azuki traits and gender can be openly accessed in Dune Analytics: dune_user_generated.”citra_azukitraits”
